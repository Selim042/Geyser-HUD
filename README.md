# Geyser HUD
The Geyser project is an re-imagining of the old Spout project that extended what Bukkit plugins were capable of by using client-side mods.  Geyser Recipes is the first in the Geyser suite of mod/plugins that will aim to do the same, extend what Bukkit plugins are capable of doing.

Geyser HUD allows plugins to render custom HUDs on the client.
